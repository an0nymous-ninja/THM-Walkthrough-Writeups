## üîç Enumeration

The first step in our assessment was to conduct an **Nmap** scan on the target machine to identify open ports and services. We ran the following command:

```bash
sudo nmap -sV -sS -A -sS -T4 10.10.51.74
```
<img src="Images/image-13.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

The **Nmap** scan revealed several important details about the target:

* A **web server** (Apache Tomcat) was found running on port `8080/tcp`. This is unusual,because normally web servers run on port 80.
* Upon further investigation, we performed a **directory enumeration** search using **Gobuster** but did not find anything useful ,we just got the default Apache Tomcat directories.

Next, we examined the **Nmap** report again and noticed a service named **AJP13** running on port `8009/tcp`. This is associated with **Apache JServ Protocol v1.3**. This service caught our attention as it could have potential vulnerabilities.

### üö® Exploiting the Apache Tomcat AJP Service

Given the presence of Apache Tomcat's AJP service, we decided to investigate potential exploits. We used the **Metasploit Framework** to search for an exploit that could take advantage of this service.

After setting the necessary payload and RHOSTS (remote host) details. 

<img src="Images/image-16.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

we executed the exploit.

<img src="Images/image-18.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

To our surprise, we successfully retrieved what appeared to be **credentials**. We decided to test these credentials by attempting an SSH login.

```bash
ssh merlin@10.10.51.74
```
<img src="Images/image-19.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

To our relief, the credentials worked, and we gained SSH access as the user **merlin**.

### üîê User Flag

After gaining SSH access, we proceeded to look for the **user.txt** flag. This flag was located in **merlin's** home directory, confirming our successful access to the user account.

### üîº Privilege Escalation

Our next objective was to escalate our privileges to **root**. We began by examining the capabilities of the user **skyfuck**, as we suspected there might be a potential avenue for privilege escalation.

<img src="Images/image-21.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

Running `sudo -l` revealed that **skyfuck** did not have any sudo permissions, so we had to investigate other possibilities.

Upon inspecting the **skyfuck** user's files, we noticed two important files:

<img src="Images/image-22.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

* One was an **encrypted PGP file**.
* The other contained **ASCII armor** data, which likely represented the key for decrypting the PGP file.

<img src="Images/image-23.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

<img src="Images/image-24.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

We attempted to import the ASCII armor into **GPG** but unfortunately could not decrypt the file. Since we weren‚Äôt able to decrypt it directly on the remote machine, we decided to download these files to our **Kali Linux** machine for further analysis.

### üöÄ Decrypting the PGP File Locally

To facilitate the decryption process, we set up a quick Python-based web server on our **Kali machine** to serve the files:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
<img src="Images/image-25.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

Then, we used **wget** to download the encrypted file to our local machine.

<img src="Images/image-26.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

Next, we used **gpg2john** to convert the `.asc` file into a hash:

```bash
gpg2john tryhackme.asc > hashes
```

<img src="Images/image-27.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

With the hash ready, we used **John the Ripper** to brute-force the passphrase:

```bash
john --format=gpg --wordlist=/home/kali/Downloads/rockyou.txt hashes
```

After some time, **John the Ripper** successfully cracked the passphrase. With the correct passphrase in hand, we returned to the target machine and decrypted the PGP file using **GPG**:

<img src="Images/image-28.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

```bash
gpg --decrypt tryhackme.asc
```
<img src="Images/image-37.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

The decrypted contents revealed the password for **merlin**, which we used to log in successfully.

### üîì Further Privilege Escalation via Misconfigured Permissions

<img src="Images/image-30.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

Although we were logged in as **merlin**, we still lacked access to the **root** flag. We examined **merlin‚Äôs** available privileges and found an unusual entry: **merlin** could run the **/usr/bin/zip** command without requiring a password.

<img src="Images/image-31.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

This was highly suspicious, as zip is typically not a command that should be run with elevated privileges.

### üîç GTFOBins: Exploiting the Zip Command

We immediately recalled a [GTFO-zip](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/zip/) entry for the `zip` command, which can be exploited for privilege escalation. **GTFOBins** is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be exploited to bypass security controls or escalate privileges on misconfigured systems.

<img src="Images/image-32.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

To exploit this, we executed the following command to run `zip` with **sudo** privileges:

```bash
TF=$(mktemp -u)
sudo zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #'
```
<img src="Images/image-34.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

This spawned a shell and allowed us to escalate our privileges to **root**, as indicated by the `uid` shown in the output.

### üí• Gaining a Root Shell

Now that we had root privileges, we spawned a fully interactive TTY shell using Python:

```bash
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

<img src="Images/image-34.png" alt="alt text" width="70%" />

We were now operating as **root**. At this point, we could access the **root.txt** flag, completing the privilege escalation process.

### üèÅ Flags Captured

* **user.txt** ‚úÖ
* **root.txt** ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Summary

* **Initial Access**: Gained SSH access using credentials obtained from an Apache Tomcat AJP service exploit.
* **Privilege Escalation**: Decrypted a PGP file to obtain **merlin‚Äôs** password, then escalated privileges by exploiting a misconfigured **zip** binary.
* **Root Access**: Spawned a TTY shell to gain root access and captured the **root.txt** flag.

* Pwned the Tomghost !!!
